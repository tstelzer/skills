# Skill Creator

## What a Skill Is

A skill is a concise, task-focused guide that tells Claude how to perform a specific job consistently.

## SKILL.md Format

Frontmatter:

```yaml
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does and when to use it.
```

Body:

- Use imperative instructions.
- Keep it short and procedural.
- Include only information Claude needs to execute the task.

## Creation Checklist

1. Identify target tasks and example user prompts.
2. Write the frontmatter description to cover when the skill should trigger.
3. Draft a minimal workflow in the body.
4. Add 1–3 concise examples if they clarify steps.
5. Remove anything not essential to the workflow.

## Rules

- Do not overexplain the "why" (unless explicitly prompted), only show the "how" of skills.
- Prefer compact code snippets over long explanations.
- Do not strictly follow the structure reference pages, simplify and group.
- Keep the main SKILL.md compact and to the point. For more specialized information, co-locate `*.md` files (sub-skills) next to the `SKILL.md`. These should not include frontmatter. Reference them like this in the `SKILL.md` top-level:

```md
[For HTTP clients](../effect-handbook/sections/30-http-server.md)
[For HTTP middleware](../effect-handbook/topics/http-middleware.md)
[For streaming](../effect-handbook/topics/stream.md)
```
