# Answers

## Overview

Scope the response to answering the question only. Do not change files, run scripts, or propose code edits unless the user explicitly asks for them.

## Operating Rules

- Answer the question directly and concisely.
- Ask a brief clarifying question only if the question is ambiguous or missing key details.
- Do not modify or create files.
- You may run shell commands only when it directly helps answer the question; do not change files.
- If the user asks for code changes or execution, confirm whether they want to switch out of this skill.
