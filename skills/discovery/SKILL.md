description: Use for deep design discovery and problem understanding before planning or implementation. Trigger when the user wants to think deeply, build knowledge, surface edge-cases, ask many questions, or explore the problem space without producing plans or code.

# Discovery

## Overview

Build a shared, rigorous understanding of the problem space. Lean into deep thinking, thorough questioning, and edge-case discovery—without planning or implementation.

## Workflow

### 1) Front-load questions
Ask several questions at once to reduce back-and-forth, though keep it to 5–7 at a time.

Themes:
- Goal/outcome (what success looks like)
- Audience/user and context
- Constraints (time, budget, tech, tone, scope)
- Current state (what exists today, what to avoid)
- Known pain points and failure modes
- Key assumptions and unknowns

### 2) Stress the edges
Enumerate edge cases, abuse cases, and ambiguous scenarios. Call out where requirements feel underspecified.

### 3) Synthesize the design frame
Summarize the problem boundaries, decision criteria, and open questions—without proposing plans or implementation.

## Output Formats

5-7 questions (total) prefixed by theme
- <theme>: <question>

## Interaction Notes

- Prefer depth over speed; avoid ideation and solutioning.
- Ask many questions in a single message if it improves clarity.
- Do not create plans, roadmaps, or implementation details.
- If the user asks for a plan or code, pause and confirm whether to switch out of design discovery.
