# Effect Handbook

## Purpose
Use this as the single source of truth for Effect-related guidance in this repository. Sections are index buckets, not a reading order.

## Routing Rules
- Do not read this handbook linearly.
- Pick one target file below.
- Follow `See also` only if that file is insufficient.
- Read exactly one: pick one target file first; only follow `See also` if needed.
- Top-level routing: intent → exact file path; sections are index buckets, not reading order.

## Conventions
- Section files: What it is | When to use | When not to use | Minimal examples | Common pitfalls | See also
- Topic files: same structure, compact (~60–120 lines)
- Paths are relative to this SKILL.md; sections and topics use relative `../` for cross-links

## When to Use This Handbook
- Implementing Effect-based services, CLIs, HTTP APIs, or tests
- Looking up primitives (Schema, Option, Either, Stream, Schedule, Queue, Layer, Config)
- Building outgoing HTTP clients or route-first HTTP apps
- Using request batching / caching or typed RPCs
- Running SQL queries, transactions, migrations, or database-backed resolvers
- Resolving common pitfalls (run boundaries, retry layers, auth middleware)
- Choosing between similar primitives (Queue vs PubSub, Ref vs STM)
- Debugging Effect execution (run boundaries, fiber interruption, scoped resources)

If one of these appears in a task, consult the reference repo README/examples first; this handbook does not yet have dedicated topic files for them.
